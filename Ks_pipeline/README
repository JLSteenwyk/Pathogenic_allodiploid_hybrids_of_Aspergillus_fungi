QUICK GUIDE:

order genes in pep and cds file to be the same prior to executing script
then execute the following command:
./execute.sh

change control file line so that there are a total of six columns
col1: spp1 short name
col2: spp1.cds
col3: spp1.pep
col4: spp2 short name
col5: spp2.cds
col6: spp2.pep

example:
col1: Tcaseinolytica 
col2: tortispora_caseinolytica.max.cds 
col3: tortispora_caseinolytica.max.pep 
col4: Tganteri 
col5: yHMPu5000035654_tortispora_ganteri_160519.max.cds 
col6: yHMPu5000035654_tortispora_ganteri_160519.max.pep
Example FA files to conduct this analysis can be found in the scripts folder

DETAILED GUIDE AND EXPLANATION:

CTL file columns:
col1: the short name for spp1 where spp1 is the	putative hybrid	of interest
col2: cds file that has	genes in the same order	as the pep file
col3: pep file that has	genes in the same order	as the cds file
col4: the short name for spp2 where spp2 is the	sister species to spp1     
col5: cds file that has	genes in the same order	as the pep file
col6: pep file that has	genes in the same order as the cds file

each fasta file should have each line of sequences have the same number of characters
For example you cannot have the following:
>not_acceptable
ATCGAGCGAACTAGCATCAGACT
ACTCGCACACACACA
CGTACGGCATACGCA

In contrast, the following is acceptable
>acceptable
ACGTACGTAGCAGCACT
ACTAGCATCAGCATCAC
ACTACGAGCGACTACGT

Concept of analyses:
The idea here is that one of the hybrid	parents	was most likely	very similar to	the sister species
and the	other parent is	likely disimilar. Therefore, after calculating Ks for each BBH between the 
two species of interest, there will be a bimodal distribution indicative of one	half of	the                            
distribution being from	parent A and the other from parent B.

The following steps of analyses are performed to do the analysis:
1) split up spp1 multi-gene pep file and singly blast each gene to the sister species (spp2) 
   to obtain a best blast hit (BBH) per gene
2) create mfastas for each gene pair, align the sequences and convert to codons
3) calculate Ks for each gene pair
